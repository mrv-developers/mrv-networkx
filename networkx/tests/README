These files are for testing the methods and functions in NX.

The tests use Python's docutils format and may be executed 
using the Python doctest and unittest framework (you need python2.4
for this) to verify the functionality of the package.

The tests also demonstrate the usage of many of the features of NX.

To run the tests for an individual module run: 

python test_single.py file.txt

The Makefile has targets to test the core, generators, and drawing
components of NetworkX

make core # test the core
make generators # test the generators
make drawing # test the drawing, some might fail if you don't have 
             # all the supporting packages

If you are running the tests after unpacking the source
the paths will be set up correctly to test everytying with

python test_all.py

To produce formatted output of all of the tests run
"make doc" and html format will be produced in the directory html/
You must have rst2html installed to do this (part of the python
docutils package).
