Thanks to Guido van Rossum for the idea of using Python for
implementing a graph data structure  
http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html

Thanks to David Eppstein for the idea of representing a graph G
so that "for n in G" loops over the nodes in G and G[n] are node n's 
neighbors.      

Thanks to everyone for making contributions to NetworkX including the 
following and many more:
