What's new in NX-0.23?
----------------------

Release date: 14 July 2005

The NetworkX web locations have changed:

https://networkx.lanl.gov/     - main documentation site
https://networkx.lanl.gov/svn  - subversion source code repository
https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki - bug tracking and info


Important Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The naming conventions in NetworkX have changed.
The package name "NX" is now "networkx".

The suggested ways to import the NetworkX package are

 - import networkx
 - import networkx as NX
 - from networkx import *

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - DiGraph reverse
  - Graph generators
     + watts_strogatz_graph now does rewiring method
     + old watts_strogatz_graph->newman_watts_strogatz_graph

Examples
~~~~~~~~
Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Changed to reflect NX-networkx change
  - main site is now https://networkx.lanl.gov/

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Fixed logic in io.py for reading DiGraphs.  
   - Path based centrality measures (betweenness, closeness)
     modified so they work on graphs that are not connected and
     produce the same result as if each connected component were
     considered separately.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Rewrite of setup scripts to install documentation and
    tests in documentation directory specified 



Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Handle calls to edges() with non-node, non-iterable items.
   - truncated_tetrahedral_graph was just plain wrong
   - Speedup of betweenness_centrality code
   - bfs_path_length now returns correct lengths 
   - Catch error if target of search not in connected component of source
