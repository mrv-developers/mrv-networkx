What's new in NX-0.27?
----------------------

Release date: 5 Feb 2006

See: https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki/timeline

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - sparse_binomial_graph: faster graph generator for sparse random graphs
  - read/write routines in io.py now handle XGraph() type and
    gzip and bzip2 files
  - optional mapping of type for read/write routine to allow
    on-the-fly conversion of node and edge datatype on read
  - Substantial changes related to digraphs and definitions of
    neighbors() and edges().  For digraphs edges=out_edges.
    Neighbors now returns a list of neighboring nodes with
    possible duplicates for graphs with parallel edges
    See https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki/ticket/24
  - Addition of out_edges, in_edges and corresponding out_neighbors
    and in_neighbors for digraphs.  For digraphs edges=out_edges.
   
Examples
~~~~~~~~
  - Minard's data for Napoleon's Russian campaign
    https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki/file/networkx/trunk/examples/minard.py

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - XGraph(multiedges=True) returns a copy of the list of edges
     for get_edge() 




What's new in NX-0.26
----------------------

Release date: 6 Jan 2006

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Simpler interface to drawing with pylab
  - G.info(node=None) function returns short information about graph
    or node
  - adj_matrix now takes optional nodelist to force ordering of
    rows/columns in matrix
  - optional pygraphviz and pydot interface to graphviz is now callable as
    "graphviz" with pygraphviz preferred.  Use draw_graphviz(G).
   
Examples
~~~~~~~~
  - Several new examples showing how draw to graphs with various
    properties of nodes, edges, and labels
    https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki/file/networkx/trunk/examples/

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Default data type for all graphs is now None (was the integer 1)
   - add_nodes_from now won't delete edges if nodes added already exist
   - Added missing names to generated graphs
   - Indexes for nodes in graphs start at zero by default (was 1)


What's new in NX-0.25?
----------------------

Release date: 5 December 2005


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Uses setuptools for installation http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools
  - Improved testing infrastructure, can now run python setup.py test
  - Added interface to draw graphs with pygraphviz
    https://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/
  - is_directed() function call

Examples
~~~~~~~~
  - Email example shows how to use XDiGraph with Python objects as
    edge data
    https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki/file/networkx/trunk/examples/unixemail.py


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Reformat menu, minor changes to Readme, better stylesheet

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - use create_using= instead of result= keywords for graph types
     in all cases
   - missing weights for degree 0 and 1 nodes in clustering     
   - configuration model now uses XGraph, returns graph with identical
     degree sequence as input sequence	   
   - fixed dijstra priority queue
   - fixed non-recursive toposort and is_directed_acyclic graph

What's new in NX-0.24?
----------------------

Release date: 20 August 2005

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Update of dijstra algorithm code
   - dfs_successor now calls proper search method
   - Changed to list compehension in DiGraph.reverse() for python2.3
     compatibility
   - Barabasi-Albert graph generator fixed
   - Attempt to add self loop should add node even if parallel edges not 
     allowed

What's new in NX-0.23?
----------------------

Release date: 14 July 2005

The NetworkX web locations have changed:

https://networkx.lanl.gov/     - main documentation site
https://networkx.lanl.gov/svn  - subversion source code repository
https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki - bug tracking and info


Important Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The naming conventions in NetworkX have changed.
The package name "NX" is now "networkx".

The suggested ways to import the NetworkX package are

 - import networkx
 - import networkx as NX
 - from networkx import *

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - DiGraph reverse
  - Graph generators
     + watts_strogatz_graph now does rewiring method
     + old watts_strogatz_graph->newman_watts_strogatz_graph

Examples
~~~~~~~~
Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Changed to reflect NX-networkx change
  - main site is now https://networkx.lanl.gov/

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Fixed logic in io.py for reading DiGraphs.  
   - Path based centrality measures (betweenness, closeness)
     modified so they work on graphs that are not connected and
     produce the same result as if each connected component were
     considered separately.

What's new in NX-0.22?
----------------------

Release date: 17 June 2005

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Topological sort, testing for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
  - Dikjstra's algorithm for shortest paths in weighted graphs
  - Multidimensional layout with dim=n for drawing
  - 3d rendering demonstration with vtk
  - Graph generators
     + random_powerlaw_tree
     + dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph


Examples
~~~~~~~~
  - Kevin Bacon movie actor graph: Examples/kevin_bacon.py
  - Compute eigenvalues of graph Laplacian: Examples/eigenvalues.py
  - Atlas of small graphs: Examples/atlas.py
  
Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Rewrite of setup scripts to install documentation and
    tests in documentation directory specified 



Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Handle calls to edges() with non-node, non-iterable items.
   - truncated_tetrahedral_graph was just plain wrong
   - Speedup of betweenness_centrality code
   - bfs_path_length now returns correct lengths 
   - Catch error if target of search not in connected component of source
   - Code cleanup to label internal functions with _name
   - Changed import statement lines to always use "import NX" to
     protect name-spaces   
   - Other minor bug-fixes and testing added
