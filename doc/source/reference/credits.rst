NetworkX was originally written by Aric Hagberg, Dan Schult, and Pieter Swart
with the help of many others.   

Thanks to Guido van Rossum for the idea of using Python for
implementing a graph data structure  
http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html

Thanks to David Eppstein for the idea of representing a graph G
so that "for n in G" loops over the nodes in G and G[n] are node n's 
neighbors.      

Thanks to all those who have improved NetworkX by contributing code,
bug reports (and fixes), documentation, and input on design, featues,
and the future of NetworkX.

Thanks especially to the following contributors.

 - Katy Bold contributed the Karate Club graph 

 - Hernan Rozenfeld added dorogovtsev_goltsev_mendes_graph and did 
   stress testing

 - Brendt Wohlberg added examples from the Stanford GraphBase

 - Jim Bagrow reported bugs in the search methods 

 - Holly Johnsen helped fix the path based centrality measures 

 - Arnar Flatberg fixed the graph laplacian routines

 - Chris Myers suggested using None as a default datatype, suggested
   improvements for the IO routines, added grid generator index tuple
   labeling and associated routines, and reported bugs

   and helped test the pygraphviz interface

 - Christopher Ellison implemented the VF2 isomorphism algorithm
   and contributed the code for matching all the graph types.
