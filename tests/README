These files are for testing the methods and functions in NX.
The tests use Python's docutils format and may be executed 
using the Python doctest and unittest framework (you need python2.4
for this) to verify the functionality of the package.

The tests also demonstrate the usage of many of the features of NX.

You can run all of the tests by just typing "make".

To produce formatted output of all of the tests run
"make doc" and html format will be produced in the directory html/
You must have rst2html installed to do this (part of the python
docutils package).
